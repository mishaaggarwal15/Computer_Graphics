**Introduction: **
Table tennis, also known as ping-pong and whiff-whaff, is a sport in which two or four players hit a lightweight ball, also known as the ping-pong ball, back and forth across a table using small rackets which here we have shown using 2 bars/paddles at other the sides. The game takes place on a hard table divided by a net, here visible as a line (2D view) for the game play. In this game, these basic scenes of a table and the ball moving across a basic background are developed using computer graphics. Here, we developed a simulation of a table tennis - cum - ping pong ball game which includes two bars, each controlled by one of the opponents and a ball moving between them, all of them with their respective animations.

It is a simple, easy to understand game developed using opengl library and glut. The players can use keyboard keys to control the game. Here, after the game play begins, both of the players have the facility to move their paddle to protect the ball from touching the boundary. If the ball touches the boundary of a player (that is the ball is out), the point is awarded to the opponent. The player with the higher score wins the game. 
After analysing all of the requirements, we decided to use OpenGL and C++ as the Language and libraries for developing the 2D scenes. This decision was made for the reason that this library has many built-in tools, plus it provided a good framework to get started. The main aim of this project was to develop a game that can depict different stages of the gameplay.


**Gameplay Instructions: **
In order to play the game, press “ ” (spacebar) to launch the ball. After pressing the spacebar key to launch the ball, the ball will start moving randomly. The players can control the paddle movement. It can be controlled by the keyboard. The player1 uses the “w” and “s” keys to move the paddle up and down, and player2 uses the “o” and “l” keys to move the paddle up and down respectively. During the game, if at any time the players wish to pause a new game, they can press the “esc” key. The goal of the game is for the player to protect the ball from touching the boundary, i.e not letting it be declared as a miss leading to loss of a point to the opponent.
