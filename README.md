Table tennis, also known as ping-pong and whiff-whaff, is a sport in which two or four players hit a lightweight ball, also known as the ping-pong ball, back and forth across a table using small rackets which here we have shown using 2 bars/paddles at other the sides. The game takes place on a hard table divided by a net here visible as a line due to the top 2D view for the game play. It is a game which we have tried to develop using Computer Graphics, these basic scenes of a table and the ball moving across it is a very basic background used in numerous similar games. So as a team, we have developed a simulation of a table tennis - cum - ping pong ball game which includes a bar controlled by 2 opponents and a ball moving between them with their respective animations.
The game we have made is a simple, easy to understand game using opengl library and glut. The players can use keyboard keys to control the game. Here, after the game play begins, both of the players have the facility to move their paddle to protect the ball from touching the boundary. If the ball touches the boundary of a player, that is the ball is out, the point is awarded to the opponent. The player with the higher score wins the game. 
Working with these requirements, we decided to use OpenGL and C++ as our Language and libraries for developing our 2D scenes. This decision was made for the reason that this library has many built-in tools and provided a good framework for the team to get started as the team members were acquainted with working with C++ before, which made it easier for us to take it up as our Language. Our aim is to develop a game that can depict different stages of the gameplay.



Gameplay Instructions
In order to play the game, press “ ” (spacebar) to launch the ball. After pressing the spacebar key to launch the ball, the ball will start moving randomly. The players can control the paddle movement. It can be controlled by the keyboard. The player1 uses the “w” and “s” keys to move the paddle up and down, and player2 uses the “o” and “l” keys to move the paddle up and down respectively. During the game, if at any time the players wish to pause a new game, they can press the “esc” key. The goal of the game is for the player to protect the ball from touching the boundary, i.e not letting it be declared as a miss leading to loss of a point to the opponent.
